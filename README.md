# A news web application made in React.js

I'm happy to introduce you to my new web application called "Tim, the news!" (I didn't really have any ideas for the name). This web application was inspired by a weekly homework given by my English teacher in 11th grade.

# Launch the project
### `npm start`
You can use **npm start** to launch the project or you can watch the **demo** on : https://timthenews.netlify.app

# The videos
I didn't import the videos but **it doesn't matter** because you just have to import the ones you want to use in the **"videos"** file..
